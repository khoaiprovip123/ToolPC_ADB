# Release Notes - v2.5.1.1

## 🛠 Hotfix & Improvements
- **Update System Robustness**: Fixed an issue where the auto-updater would fail to recognize version tags with extra dots (e.g., `v.2.5.1.0`). This ensures smoother updates for all future versions.

## 🚀 Features from v2.5.1.0 (Included)
- **Show FPS & Refresh Rate Monitor**: New tool to toggle system FPS overlay, with Auto and Manual (Developer Options) fallback modes.
- **Advanced Refresh Rate Control**: Force specific Hz values (60, 90, 120, 144Hz) or reset to Auto.
- **Unified Xiaomi Suite ("Bộ Xiaomi")**: Consolidated all Xiaomi tools (Debloater, Quick Tools, Advanced) into a single, flattened menu structure.
- **UI Improvements**: Fixed layout overlaps in "Advanced Features" and increased default window size to 1450x850.
